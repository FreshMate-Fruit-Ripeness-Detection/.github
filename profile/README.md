# FreshMate - Capstone Project Bangkit Team C242-PS007

## Overview

This project intends to help fruit farmers, fruit sellers, and consumers determine fruit quality by creating a machine-learning model that can classify fruit ripeness into three categories: "unripe," "ripe," and "rotten." The classification procedure uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with a pre-trained ResNet50 model implemented with TensorFlow and other related libraries.

## Motivation

Fruit waste is frequently caused by incorrectly classifying fruit ripeness during the sorting and grading process. Incorrect evaluations can result in the premature dumping of underripe or overripe fruits, amounting to significant food waste. Using visual analysis of image, our model is intended to assist users in determining the ripeness category of fruits, such as unripe, ripe, or rotten.

## Project Scope

The primary objective of this project is to develop a fruit ripeness classification system with the following features:
- Image Classification: The model is designed to classify fruit ripeness in images uploaded by users into three categories: unripe, ripe, or rotten.

## Dataset

The dataset used to train the model was obtained from a public URL hosted on our Google Cloud Platform: [Dataset](link dataset.zip). 

## Implementation

The system aims to create technology that can capture photos of fruit, process them with a trained CNN model, and then predict whether the fruit is unripe, ripe, or rotten. An Android app with a Google Cloud backend will deliver real-time predictions and updates.

## Future Enhancements

Future enhancements may include:
- Dataset Addition with Fruit Types: Adding multiple types of fruits to the dataset enhances data diversity while also assuring that the model can recognize more categories of fruits with greater accuracy.
- Fruit Health Analysis: In addition to recognizing ripeness and spoiling levels, the model can detect fruit health issues such as the presence of illness or damage.
- Action Recommendation Feature: Included features that offer specific advice for each fruit group, such as:
  - Unripe: Storage guidance until the fruit reaches the optimal ripeness level.
  - Tidak matang: Tips penyimpanan hingga matang.
  - Ripe: Recommendations on the best time to consume or sell.
  - Rotten: Advice on recycling options or proper disposal methods.

## Conclusion

This project is a strategic step toward using machine learning to address food waste within the agriculture sector, specifically in the fruit supply chain. Our goal is to minimize food waste by providing precise predictions of fruit ripeness, eliminating the uncertainty that often comes with assessing whether fruit is ripe or not.
