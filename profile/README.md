# FreshMate - Capstone Project Bangkit Team C242-PS007

## Overview

This project intends to help fruit farmers, fruit sellers, and consumers determine fruit quality by creating a machine-learning model that can classify fruit ripeness into three categories: "unripe," "ripe," and "rotten." The classification procedure uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with a pre-trained ResNet50 model implemented with TensorFlow and other related libraries.

## Motivation

Fruit waste is frequently caused by incorrectly classifying fruit ripeness during the sorting and grading process. Incorrect evaluations can result in the premature dumping of underripe or overripe fruits, amounting to significant food waste. Using visual analysis of image, our model is intended to assist users in determining the ripeness category of fruits, such as unripe, ripe, or rotten.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is sourced from a public URL on our Google Cloud Platform: [Dataset](link dataset.zip). 

## Implementation

The system aims to create technology that can capture photos of fruit, process them with a trained CNN model, and then predict whether the fruit is unripe, ripe, or rotten. An Android app with a Google Cloud backend will deliver real-time predictions and updates.
